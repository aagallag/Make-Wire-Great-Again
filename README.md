# Make Wire Great Again


## Getting Started
There are multiple ways to import the project into Android Studio, but this seems to be the easiest.

- Clone this repo to the folder of your choice.
- Launch Android Studio, if you already have a project open, click `File -> Close Project`.
- At the main welcome wizard, click `Import project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, ect.)` and navigate to the folder you cloned the repo to.
- To compile, go to `Build -> Make Project (Ctrl + F9)`
- To install and run on a connected Android phone, go to `Run -> Run 'app' (Shift + F10)`


## TODO
- Disable the ping button
- Disable the call button
- Update MainActivity to include buttons to allow the above features to be quickly toggled on/off
- Configure Travis-CI builds
